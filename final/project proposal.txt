I'm going to design a game that is similar to Snake. 
The player will control a snake using buttons or a joystick
(whichever I deem is better for the gameplay). 
Every time they collect an object, use the buttons or joystick to turn, 
or bump into things, there will be a unique sound that is 
specific to the event. 
On the screen, you will see where the object is generated and 
watch yourself control the snake.
The snake will grow bigger as you collect items. 

I plan to make this more detailed and less blocky in the future developement.
